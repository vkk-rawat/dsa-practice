Complex relationships can be shown with the help of graphs data structures.
GRAPHS consists of NODES and EDGES.
Graph is set or ordered or unordered pair of vertices and edges.

G=(V,E) represent a graph G with vertices V and edges E.

Types of graphs on the basis of edges.
Directed and undirected graphs.

In directed graph a logical directed edge is formed i.e the edges are ordered.
They are unidirectional or they have direction

In undirected graph a logical undirected edge is formed i.e the edges


HOW TO TRAVERSE A GRAPH:-----------

DFS 
In Depth first search all the nodes at the
